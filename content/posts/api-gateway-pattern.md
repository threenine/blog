An API Gateway is a server that is the single entry point into the system. It is similar to the Facade pattern from 
objectâ€‘oriented design. The API Gateway encapsulates the internal system architecture and provides an API that is 
tailored to each client. It might have other responsibilities such as authentication, monitoring, load balancing, 
caching, request shaping and management, and static response handling.
