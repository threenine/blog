title: What are Web Sockets
subtitle: An explanation of the WebSocket protocol and API's
description: WebSockets are a bi-directional, full duplex communications
  protocol initiated over HTTP. They are commonly used in modern web
  applications for streaming data and other asynchronous traffic.
category: API Development
summary: WebSocket is a bidirectional communication protocol based on TCP that
  standardizes communication between a client and a server, allowing for both
  parties to request data from one another. In contrast, a unidirectional
  protocol like HTTP only allows for the client to request data from the server.
