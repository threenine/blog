In [What is an API](https://threenine.blog/posts/what-is-an-api "What is an API | threenine.co.uk") we introduced and discussed some of the
basics concepts and terms associated with what is defined as an API or _Application Programming Interface_. 

A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or Representational State Transfer
architectural style. The software architectural style that was created to guide the design and development of the
architecture for the World Wide Web. REST defines a set of constraints for how the architecture of an Internet-scale 
distributed hypermedia system, such as the Web, should behave. The REST architectural style emphasises the scalability 
of interactions between components, uniform interfaces, independent deployment of components, and the creation of a 
layered architecture to facilitate caching of components to reduce user-perceived latency, enforce security, and 
encapsulate legacy systems. 

The REST Architectural style was first defined in 2000 by computer scientist Dr. Roy Fielding in his doctoral 
dissertation, to provides a relatively high level of flexibility and freedom for developers. This flexibility is just 
one reason why REST APIs have emerged as a common method for connecting components and applications in a microservices 
architecture.
