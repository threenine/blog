Starting a new API project can be a daunting task, especially if you are not sure where to start.  There are a number 
of different approaches you can take, but one of the most popular approaches is to adopt an API First approach, which 
can help to improve your chances of success.

## What is API First?

_API First_ is a term and a concept that gained popularity during the brief Digital Transformation hype train of 2019-2021,
most importantly it is also a term that is often used in conjunction with the term [_API Gateway_](https://threenine.blog/posts/api-gateway-pattern) 
and _API Management_.  

API-first is a product-centric approach to developing APIs. It views the role of APIs as discrete products, rather 
than integrations to be subsumed within other systems. The overall goal is to produce a set of modular, interoperable APIs 
which, when combined, create an API platform that will help to foster and drive further innovation.

The term _API First_ is often used to describe the process of designing and developing an API, however, the truth is 
API First is more than just developing an API.  It is a business process that is designed to help organisations to think
and focus on the business value of the API and how it will be used by the consumers of the API.

Originally, the term _API First_ was coined by [Kin Lane](https://kinlane.com/) in 2011, when he was working at [API Evangelist](https://apievangelist.com/).
Kin Lane is a well known API Evangelist and has been working in the API space for a number of years.  He has been
instrumental in helping to shape the API industry and has been a strong advocate of the _API First_ approach.

API-first is an approach to software design that centers on the API. It should be possible to perform every action via
the scripting language and every piece of functionality should be available for other systems to leverage.

At its core, _API First_ helps to focus on 3 main aspects or pillars of the business organisation and how they can be 
improved by adopting an _API First_ approach. These three pillars are:

* **Business**

  
API First is help organisations to embrace APIs at the business level, and to understand that while APIs are not 
  the only important aspect of business software, they are the products that you create, manage, sell, measure, 
  recombine, and retire. API First means that if a product in your organisation does not have an API, it essentially 
  does not exist. APIs are the connective fabric that allows your organisation to create value and to be able to quickly 
  adapt your value chains in response to internal and external feedback.


* **Organisational**

  
API First means that all teams embrace the fact that whatever they create has to be delivered through an API. It 
  also means that teams understand that API quality establishes an upper threshold for product quality: No matter 
  how good your service or product is, if it is delivered through a bad API, this substantially diminishes the 
  quality of the product. Essentially, the organizational aspect of API First is to understand that as a result of 
  digital transformation, organizations become easily reconfigurable meshes of API-delivered services, and anything 
  that compromises this vision is problematic for long-term success

* **Technology**

    
All products are designed with their API in mind. The API is the first _User Interface (UI)_ in the sense that 
    it defines and limits the kinds of interactions that a product supports. Concrete UIs that are later built may 
    only use parts of the API, or they may combine various products into one UX, but in terms of pure product 
    capabilities, the API is the single source of truth.  This is why designing and discussing APIs 
    should be done before implementation starts. Early prototypes with possibly limited functionality should be 
    produced as quickly as possible, but even before that sitting down with potential users and discussing design 
    options and preferences can be extremely valuable. 

With the right iterative approach the API can grow in an 
    evolutionary manner (adding more features over time as they are requested). As a general guideline, always 
    discussing designs before implementing them helps with creating more user-friendly APIs. Since the API is one 
    of the essential aspects of all products, documenting it becomes important. While the level of documentation 
    depends on intended audience size and how much the Developer Experience (DX) of the API is thought to be a 
    deciding factor, documentation should be seen as an essential part of each API. Structured documentation such 
    as API labels can help to document APIs in a more structured way, so that growing and evolving API landscapes 
    are easier to understand and manage.

### API First Principles

These concepts and pillars are the foundation of the _API First_ approach and are the guiding principles that start to guide
the organisation to start thinking about APIs as products and how they can be used to improve the business, put them into 
practice. 

The core three core principles of API first to focus on are :

* **API as first UI** 

Every product gets designed with its API in mind. The API is the first UI in the sense that it defines and limits the 
kinds of interactions that a product supports. Concrete UIs that are later built may only use parts of the API, or they 
may combine various products into one UX, but in terms of pure product capabilities, the *_API is the single source of truth_*.

* **API before Implementation**

Designing and discussing APIs should be done before implementation starts. Early prototypes with possibly limited 
functionality should be produced as quickly as possible, but even before that sitting down with potential users and 
discussing design options and preferences can be extremely valuable. With the right iterative approach the API can grow 
in an evolutionary manner (adding more features over time as they are requested). As a general guideline, 
always discussing designs before implementing them helps with creating more user-friendly APIs.

* **API Documentation**

Since the API is one of the essential aspects of all products, documenting it becomes important. While the level of 
documentation depends on intended audience size and how much the Developer Experience (DX) of the API is thought to be 
a deciding factor, documentation should be seen as an essential part of each API. Structured documentation such as 
API labels can help to document APIs in a more structured way, so that growing and evolving API landscapes are easier 
to understand and manage.

### Adopting the API First approach

The above core principles will help guide you to start thinking about APIs and how they can be used to help your
organisation achieve its goals.  The next step is to start putting them into practice.  The best way to do this is to
start by creating an API First Strategy, and adopting an API First mindset. There are a few key concepts to consider 
and always put at the forefront of your mind when adopting an API First approach.

#### 1. APIs are Products
Developing and publishing an API may at first seem easy. However, what is truly difficult is actually preparing an API
for public consumption. That’s the difference between merely creating APIs and treating them as products. 

An API-first approach requires you to think about:
* how developers will interact with your API
* how you’ll educate them on its functionality
* how you’ll maintain it over time
* which tools to use to build the API
* how you’ll adhere to standards of compatibility, security, and simplicity.

When a company builds a product, it must meet industry standards. For APIs, this means practicing foundational software 
design and development cycles that deliver a quality software product. Product development includes upfront design and 
specifications, peer programming, technology choices and programming languages support that match the API’s goals, 
the decision between cloud and on-site, testing, and user research.

#### 2. Foundational Design

API-first design requires organisations and developers to think about APIs from the very beginning. The API should be 
designed and developed first. This means that the API is the first user interface (UI) in the sense that it defines
and limits the kinds of interactions that a product supports.

Traditionally, organisations have focused on the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of their products, before
thinking of the API, and the API is often an afterthought, and worse its design is primarily driven by the needs and 
requirements of the User Interface.  This is a massive mistake, and often leads to poor quality APIs

API-first development treats APIs as the foundation. Instead of pre-built or opinionated software solutions or experiences, 
it ensures that all of a platform’s functionality is accessible to you through the APIs.

#### 3. Team Collaboration

API-first development is more than just technical standards. It’s a way of working and collaborating. Rather than just
being concerned with the specifics of each API, an API-first approach is more about looking at your teams and operations
that surround those APIs.

Achieving an API-first environment requires strong leadership from a product manager who is both knowledgeable about 
APIs and equipped with sufficient technical skills. It also requires skilled developers. Although most enterprise 
developers maybe good at delivering exceptional end-user experiences. It is a completely different skill set to
creating good engineering (or developer) experience (DX). You need a customer success function to help with 
implementation and support to field ongoing queries and user feedback.

#### 4. API Contract

Creating open and accessible APIs, companies can reuse, redeploy, and share functionality easily. But that’s easier 
said than done. One way to promote re-usability is through consistent API description language. Specifically, this 
creates a contract dictating how an API is supposed to behave. Establishing a contract involves spending more time
thinking about the design of an API and often involves additional planning and collaboration.

### API First is not easy

Adopting an API First approach is not easy, and it is not a quick fix.  It is a long term strategy that requires
commitment and dedication.  It is a strategy that requires you to think about APIs as products and how they can be used
to help your organisation achieve its goals.  

The API First strategy requires you to think about APIs as end products and how they can be used to help your organisation
achieve its goals or generating alternative revenue streams and enhancing existing product portfolios.  This requires 
you to think about the business value of the API and how it will be used by the consumers of the API.

Business and technical leaders need to embark on API-first transformations with their eyes wide open. The skills and mindset
required to succeed are different from those needed for traditional software development. The API-first approach requires
a different way of thinking about software development and the role of APIs in the business.

#### Corporate cultural change

The key, and often overlooked aspect of the API First approach, is that it often requires a complete cultural change within
the corporate approach, in that it requires thinking of your IT platforms not as a competitive advantage or transformation
but as fully fledged additional products and services that your organisation offers.

The concept shares some principles with the API Economy, where APIs unlock new sources of value and more importantly additional revenue.
It’s a holistic view of APIs as building blocks to create new products, favouring modular, reusable APIs over larger, 
monolithic APIs.
